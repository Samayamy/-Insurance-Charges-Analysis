Insurance Charges Analysis using demographic and behavioral factors (age, smoking status, number of children, etc.) with visual insights through an interactive dashboard.

# 🏥 Insurance Charges Analysis

This project presents an analytical overview of how various demographic and lifestyle factors impact insurance charges. The analysis is visualized through a dashboard built from a real-world dataset of 1,338 customers.

---

## 🎯 Objective

The main objective of this project is to:
- Identify trends and patterns in insurance charges.
- Examine how variables such as age, smoking status, number of children, and BMI influence insurance premiums.
- Provide actionable insights through visual storytelling using a dashboard.

---

## 📊 Dashboard Summary

The dashboard visualizes key metrics and breakdowns such as:
- **Average and highest insurance charges**
- **Charges by age group, smoker status, and children count**
- **Demographics distribution (age, smoker/non-smoker, children)**
- **BMI comparison by gender and smoking behavior**



---

## 🔍 Key Findings

- **Smokers pay 280% more** in insurance charges compared to non-smokers, indicating smoking as the most significant cost driver.
- **Age has a direct correlation** with insurance cost: individuals over 50 pay on average \$18K, compared to \$9K for those under 25.
- **Most customers (79.5%) are non-smokers**, but the small group of smokers contributes significantly to the higher average charges.
- **Customers without children form the largest group**, followed by those with one or two children.
- **BMI levels** are relatively consistent across gender, with slight variations between smokers and non-smokers.

## 📁 Dataset Overview

The dataset used contains 1,338 records with the following attributes:
- `age`
- `sex`
- `bmi`
- `children`
- `smoker`
- `region`
- `charges` (target variable)

These attributes help identify risk factors that influence insurance pricing.

## 🧠 Conclusion

The analysis clearly shows that:
- **Smoking status and age** are primary factors in determining insurance premiums.
- **Lifestyle habits**, such as smoking, have a significantly greater cost implication than other variables like BMI or number of children.
- **Visual dashboards** are highly effective in communicating complex data-driven insights in a simple, engaging manner.

This project demonstrates how insurance companies can leverage data analytics to better understand risk segments and design pricing strategies accordingly.
